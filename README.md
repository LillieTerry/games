Military games and the military shooter
=============

Looking for the best military shooter or shall I say the best game ever? Have been browsing a cool video games and PC games and stumbled-upon with these lists of awesome greatest military shooters. Ok, so, let say that these lists were old, maybe, but here the thing, like Tom Clancyâ€™s Rainbow Six, the warfare begins.

One of my best military shooters includes Dragon Rising, Red Orchestra 2, SOCOM 2 and [US military bases Hawaii](http://militarybases.co/directory/hickam-air-force-base-in-honolulu-hi/). You can have the tactical shooters anytime you want.
